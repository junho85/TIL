https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696[RFC 3696 - J. Klensin February 2004] 에서는 320 자 라고 되어 있음
----
   In addition to restrictions on syntax, there is a length limit on
   email addresses.  That limit is a maximum of 64 characters (octets)
   in the "local part" (before the "@") and a maximum of 255 characters
   (octets) in the domain part (after the "@") for a total length of 320
   characters.  Systems that handle email should be prepared to process
   addresses which are that long, even though they are rarely
   encountered.
