Stage, Debugging Abilities and Habits.

.Novice
* Lacks debugging skills
* Repeats the same types of defects frequently throughout a program
* Debugs programs haphazardly instead of following a plan
* Spends considerable amounts of time on debugging
* Gives up easily and depends on others for assistance

.Advanced Beginner
* Develops debugging skills through experience; recognizes symptoms of previously experienced defects
* Repeats the same types of defects occasionally throughout a program
* Begins adapting approaches to debugging based on prior successes and failures
* Attempts less familiar debugging techniques only as a last resort
* Relies to some extent on others for assistance

.Competent
* Knows a variety of debugging techniques
* Approaches debugging systematically; evaluates the situation to determine which techniques to use
* Alternates between techniques when certain techniques are not effective
* Identifies most defects independently

.Proficient
* Sees debugging as part of program development as a whole
* Develops skills in other areas of program development to facilitate debugging
* Optimizes decision-making abilities and approaches to debugging
* Asks others for assistance rarely and assists others

.Expert
* Approaches debugging intuitively due to extensive experience; debugging is second-nature
* Identifies complex and/or unfamiliar defects successfully
* Asks others for assistance rarely and assists others
